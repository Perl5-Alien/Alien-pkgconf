NAME
    Alien::pkgconf - Discover or download and install pkgconf + libpkgconf

SYNOPSIS
     use Alien::pkgconf;
 
     my $cflags = Alien::pkgconf->cflags;
     my $libs   = Alien::pkgconf->libs;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides you with the information that you need to invoke
    "pkgconf" or link against "libpkgconf". It isn't intended to be used
    directly, but rather to provide the necessary package by a CPAN module
    that needs "libpkgconf", such as PkgConfig::LibPkgConf.

METHODS
  cflags
     my $cflags = Alien::pkgconf->cflags;

    The compiler flags for compiling against "libpkgconf".

  libs
     my $libs = Alien::pkgconf->libs;

    The linker flags for linking against "libpkgconf".

  dynamic_libs
     my($dll) = Alien::pkgconf->dynamic_libs;

    The ".so", ".dll" or <.dynlib> shared or dynamic library which can be
    used via FFI.

  bin_dir
     my($dir) = Alien::pkgconf->bin_dir;

    The directory where you can find "pkgconf". If it is not already in the
    "PATH". Adding this to "PATH" should make tools that require "pkgconf"
    work.

  install_type
     my $type = Alien::pkgconf->install_type;

    The type of install, should be either "share" or "system".
