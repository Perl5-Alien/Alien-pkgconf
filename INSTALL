This is the Perl distribution Alien-pkgconf

To use this module you need Perl 5.8.1 or better, and make installed on 
your system first.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm Alien::pkgconf

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S Alien::pkgconf

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan Alien::pkgconf

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test

Then install it:

    % make install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo make install

## Documentation

Alien::pkgconf documentation is available as POD. You can run perldoc 
from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc Alien::pkgconf
